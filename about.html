            <h2 class="header">Catastrophe</h2>
            <p class="detail">There are a lot of perks for joining the Catastrophe. First, we support our players with daily scrimmage with their own time availability. For casual players or team we required them to play scrims for atleast once a day and
              for competetive players or team they have a target total scrims a month. Next, we provide a seasonal event or tournaments. As of now we handled 
              three big tournaments and it was succesful. Third, we provide a monthly clan event where we make challenges for everyone that they can enjoy and win some cod points too.
              Lastly, we provide a task for players to improve their gameplays by doing some daily tasks.</p>
